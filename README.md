# Congressional-Bill-Prediction
Scraped and wrangled 20 years of Congressional data in an attempt to predict whether a bill will make it out of committee, and whether a bill will become a law. Predicted if a bill would make it out of committee with 77% recall

# Process
I used the ProPublica API to scrape congressional bills from 1997 to 2017, or Congresses 105-115. This data was combined with MIT researcher Christ Stewart's congressional committee data to create the final dataset. 

This blog describes the data gathering, cleaning, and enginnering process.
